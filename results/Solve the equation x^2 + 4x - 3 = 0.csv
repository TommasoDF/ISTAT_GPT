Therefore, the solutions to the equation x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0 are x = -2 + √7 and x = -2 - √7.",0.4999999999994681
1.7,"To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0, we will use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac))/(2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the variables.

In this equation, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -3.

substituting those values into the quadratic formula and solving it, we get:

x = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(-3)))/(2(1)).

Simplifying the above equation further:

x = (-4 ± √(16 + 12))/2.

x = (-4 ± √28)/2.
  
x = (-4 ± 2√7)/2.

Reducing:
x = (2(-2 ± √7))/(2).

1.72,"To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula.

The quadratic formula states: If the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 has solutions x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac))/(2a), then the solutions for x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0 are:

x = (-4 ± √((4)^2 - 4(1)(-3)))/(2(1))

Simplifying further,

x = (-4 ± √(16 + 12))/2

Therefore, the solutions for the equation are:
x = (-4 + √28)/2 ≈ 0.535,
x = (-4 - √28)/2 ≈ -4.535.

So, the solution set for x in the equation x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0 is {0.535, -4.535}.",0.3548387096770378
