To do this, you can take the square root of both sides of the equation. However, it's important to consider both the positive and negative square roots because a positive and negative number squared will give the same result.

Taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we have:
√(x^2) = √2
x = ±√2
x ≈ ±1.414

Therefore, the two solutions to the equation x^2 = 2 are approximately x = 1.414 and x = -1.414.","As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data. However, based on the data available up to 2019, the estimated population of Italy was around 60.4 million. It's important to note that population figures tend to change over time due to various factors such as birth rates, death rates, migration, and other demographic factors. For the most accurate and up-to-date population statistics for Italy in 2020, it's recommended to refer to credible sources like the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) or the World Bank."
