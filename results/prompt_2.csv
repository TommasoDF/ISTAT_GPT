Factoring:
Currently, the equation cannot be easily factored using simple integer values. Therefore, we'll need to apply the quadratic formula.

Quadratic formula:
The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions for x can be found using the formula: 

x = (-b �� sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

For this equation, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -3.

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula:

x = (-4 �� sqrt(4^2 - 4*2*(-3))) / (2*2)
  = (-4 �� sqrt(16 + 24)) / 4
  = (-4 �� sqrt(40)) / 4
  = (-4 �� 2sqrt(10)) / 4

Simplifying:
x1 = (-4 + 2sqrt(10)) / 4 = (2 - sqrt(10)) / 2 = 1 - sqrt(10)/2

and

x2 = (-4 - 2sqrt(10)) / 4 = (2 + sqrt(10)) / 2 = 1 + sqrt(10)/ 2

In this equation, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -3, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

2x^2 + 4x = 3
Dividing by 2, we have:

A = 2

1.76,"Using the quadratic formula, we have x=(-b �� ���(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).

a = 6

Let's plug these values into the quadratic formula:

x = (-4 �� ���(4^2 - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2))
x = (-4 �� ���(16 + 24)) / 4
x = (-4 �� ���(40)) / 4
x = (-4 �� 2���(10)) / 4

Now divide both terms separately by 2 to simplify this expression:

x = (-2 �� ���(10)) / 2
x = -1 �� (1/2)���(10)

x = (-(4) �����((4)^2 - 4(2)(-3)))/(2(2))

Simplifying inside the square root:

= (-4 �����40)/4

= (-4 �����(10 �� 4))/4

1.94,"We can solve this equation by using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that for any equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions for x are given by:
x = [-b �� ���(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a.

For this equation, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we have:

x = [-4 �� ���(4^2 - 4(2)(-3))]/(2(2))

Simplifying the discriminant underneath the square root:
x = [-4 �� ���(16 + 24)] /4
x = [-4 �� ���(40)] / 4
x = [-4 �� ���(4*10)]/4
x = [-4 �� 2���10] / 4
